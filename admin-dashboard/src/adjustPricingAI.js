You are a pricing assistant AI. Based on the product details below, suggest an optimal price in Indian Rupees (â‚¹), and also explain your reasoning.

Product Details:
- Name: ${product.name}
- Ingredients: ${product.ingredients}
- Tracking ID: ${product.trackingId}
- Packed On: ${product.packedOnDate}
- Expiry Date: ${product.expiryDate}
- Current Price: â‚¹${product.price}

Pricing Guidelines:
- If the product is close to its expiry date (within 7 days), reduce the price to encourage quick sales.
- If the product is newly packed or still fresh, price can remain or increase slightly.
- Use simple and clear logic in your explanation.
- Your response must start with the new price (â‚¹) on the first line, followed by a short explanation (2-3 lines max).

Example output:

â‚¹145.00  
This price was suggested because the product is still fresh (expiry is 20 days away). A slight increase from the current price is reasonable due to high shelf life.

Now, generate the result:
`;

  const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
  const response = await result.response;
  const text = await response.text();

  // Split the price and explanation
  const [firstLine, ...rest] = text.trim().split("\n");
  const suggestedPrice = parseFloat(firstLine.replace(/[â‚¹\s]/g, ""));
  const explanation = rest.join(" ").trim();

  return {
    suggestedPrice: suggestedPrice || product.price,
    explanation: explanation || "No explanation provided."
  };
}
